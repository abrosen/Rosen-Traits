# Rosen-Traits
![Preview Image](About/Preview.png "Preview")

## What?
These are traits that are primarily focused on Combat Extended, modifying some stats around combat.  Thanks to the post-processing curve, if I end making a bit too much of an adjustment, it won't have a huge impact.  Includes (non-exhaustive)

- Burly traits adjust carrying capcity and melee damage.
- Steady and quick handed traits for CE
- A duelist trait for your melee pawns
- Metabolism traits to affect hunger
- Traits that modify recreation need and fall rates.

All traits are XML patches, so pretty much only affect stats.

## Why?
Like I said, madification of CE stats are a bit of an untapped area.  I also wanted to see what I could modify easily.
