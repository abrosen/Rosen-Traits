# Rosen-Traits

## What?
These are traits that are primarily focused on Combat Extended, modifying some stats around combat.  Thanks to the post-processing curve, if I end making a bit too much of an adjustment, it won't have a huge impact.

## Why?
Like I said, madification of CE stats are a bit of an untapped area.  I also wanted to see what I could modify easily.
